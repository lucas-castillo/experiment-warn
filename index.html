        Hello and thank you for taking part in this experiment.

        In this experiment you will watch some animations and perform a task for each of them.

        Whenever you are ready, click next to see more detailed instructions and make sure you read them carefully.

    </instructions>


    <instructions process ="{true}">
        <b style="color:red">WARNING: This experiment contains flashing lights.</b>

        If you believe you will be affected please leave the experiment now.

    <instructions process="{true}">
        In the following screen, you will watch some animations in order to learn how different squares interact. Please watch carefully.

        Afterwards, you will be asked to select which of two animations you watched.

   <instructions process="{true}">
       In the next few trials, the screen will flash and we will ask you to synchronize the time of the flashing with the motion of one of the squares.
       To do so, you will use a slider to change when the flash appears, moving it left to make it appear earlier and moving it right to make it appear later.
       In the next screen you can see how that works.
   </instructions>

   <slider-practice></slider-practice>

   <instructions process="{true}">
        Excellent! You will now see another animation showing how different squares interact. Again, pay close attention, as you will be asked which of two animations you watched.
   </instructions>

   <learn-collision></learn-collision>
    <test-collision></test-collision>

   <instructions>
       Now, you will see the same animation <b>again</b>. Synchronize the flash on the screen with the time when the blue square starts moving.
       As you saw before, you can change the moment the flash appears on screen by moving the slider.
