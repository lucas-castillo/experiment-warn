        Hello and thank you for taking part in this experiment.

        In this experiment you will watch some animations and perform a task for each of them.

        Whenever you are ready, click next to see more detailed instructions and make sure you read them carefully.

    </instructions>


    <instructions process ="{true}">
        <b style="color:red">WARNING: This experiment contains flashing lights.</b>

        If you believe you will be affected please leave the experiment now.

    <instructions process="{true}">
        In the following screen, you will watch some animations showing how objects move on the screen and what we will be asking of you.

        Please watch these animations carefully since you will be later asked to report what you saw.
    </instructions>

    <instructions process="{true}">
        In the next few trials, the screen will flash and we will ask you to synchronize the time of the flashing with the motion of one of the squares.
        To do so, you will use a slider to change when the flash appears, moving it left to make it appear earlier and moving it right to make it appear later.
        In the next screen you can see how that works.
    </instructions>

    <slider-practice></slider-practice>

    <instructions process="{true}">
        Excellent! You will now see another animation showing different squares moving on screen. Again, pay close attention, as you will be asked a question on the animation you watch.

    <instructions>
        Now, you will see the same animation <b>again</b>. First, you will tell us how confident you are that you can see the correct order of events by moving a slider.
    </instructions>

    <confidence></confidence>

    <instructions process="{true">
        In the next screen we will show you the animation one more time.

        This time, we want you to synchronize the flash on the screen with the time when the blue square starts moving, using the slider as you did before.
